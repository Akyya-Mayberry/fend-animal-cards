                Most rabbits reside in North America with the most common breed being the European Rabbit.
                Rabbits live in groups inside of burrows. Males are called bucks and females are called does.
                Young rabbits are actually called kittens (bunnies too) and are blind and hairless at birth!
                Rabbits are herbivores. What's pretty fascinating, but also yucky is that
                they eat parts of their own feces to aid in digestion.
